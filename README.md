# OTP_AUTO_READ
This is a demo project to auto read OTP in react native.
We are using this library to read message without asking any new permission -> https://github.com/faizalshap/react-native-otp-verify
This library internaly using the google SMS Retrieval API to verify message in android. 



In order to detect the message, SMS message must include a hash(11 character) that identifies your app. This hash can be obtained by using the getHash() method.
message structure should be like this and be no longer than 140 bytes -> 

Your OTP is 4267 for exampleApp. eRUQmcCmqjQ
